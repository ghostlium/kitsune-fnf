# kitsune-fnf
Scuffed converter of FNF JSON to Championship Islands JSON. Needs heavy amount of tweaking and understanding of music timing. 

Input the json file as data.json. The script will then create a file called bruh.json. 

Currently, there is an issue with timing. I am unable to check this right now, so hopefully someone can do that for me. For those unfamiliar with FNF, it appears that the songs have two audio files, instrumental and voices. I would recommend putting them together with Audacity when testing.

You may c/p the stuff in the bruh.json file into the Gu array in the Championship Islands JSON as well as replace the FNF music with disco.ogg and disco.mp3 to ensure that it works.
